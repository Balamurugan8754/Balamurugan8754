## 🏗️ Projects
Here are some of my notable projects:

# Web Scraping Project for a Job Portal 🏢
I have scraped data from a job portal using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests and cleaned and preprocessed data to get insights and trends such as popular job titles, skills, and job locations. I also visualized the data using Python libraries such as Plotly and Pandas.

# ML Project 🏢

# Real-Time Detection and Classification of Steel Plate Scratches using YOLOv8

I have built a deep learning model for classifying steel plates into three categories using the Steel Manufacturing Plant Dataset. I preprocessed data using tools such as Roboflow and Label studio, built and evaluated different YOLOv8 model weights such as YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, and YOLOv8x utilizing an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for training, After identifying yolov8x as the best model, I fine-tuned it to optimize its performance..

# Real-Time Detection and Classification of Fish Species Using YOLOv10

I have built a deep learning model for classifying fish species into five categories. Gathering Data on Fish Videos from Ponds in Japan. I preprocessed data using tools such as Roboflow and Computer Vision Annotation Tool, built and evaluated different YOLOv10 model weights such as YOLOv10-L and YOLOv10-X utilizing an Nvidia RTX 6000 GPU for training, YOLOv10-X showed a high level of accuracy; therefore, I modified it for performance at the highest level possible.

# Real-Time Detection of Grapes Using YOLO-World

A deep learning model that I developed can identify grapes within a plant. Data collection from agricultural plantations in Japan. I used Roboflow and Computer Vision Annotation Tool to preprocess the data. I then built and evaluated several YOLO-World model weights, including YOLOv8m-world, YOLOv8l-world and YOLOv8x-world using an Nvidia RTX 6000 GPU for training. YOLOv10-X showed a significant level of accuracy, so I adjusted it to ensure the highest level of performance.

# Neural Radiance Field project   🏢 

# Instant Neural Graphics Primitives 

I constructed the image of the disable nuclear power station in order to effectively represent high-resolution 3D scenes.

# 3D Gaussian Splatting

I created an image of the disabled nuclear power plant to accurately illustrate rendering 3D scenes.
